# Identify Fraud from Enron Email

Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, I am building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.
